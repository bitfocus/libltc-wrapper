# libltc wrapper

This module gives you access to the libltc library from node.js.

This module is released with the MIT license, but libltc in it self is a LGPL library. But as long as you install the `libltc` library as a separate library, the license should not infer with your project, it being open source or closed source.

# Installation

You need to install the librtc library on your computer first. On a mac you would use Homebrew to install it with the command `brew install librtc`

# State
